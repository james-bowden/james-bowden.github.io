                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p><br/>I am a Rosenberg Scholar and <a href="http://cms.caltech.edu/people/klbouman">Assistant Professor </a> of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) and Electrical Engineering at Caltech in Pasadena, California. 
                    My research focuses on computational imaging: designing systems that tightly integrate algorithm and sensor design, making it possible to observe phenomena previously difficult or impossible to measure with traditional approaches. 
                    My group at Caltech combines ideas from signal processing, computer vision, machine learning, and physics to find and exploit hidden signals for both scientific discovery and technological innovation. 
                    <!-- The focus of my research is on using emerging computational methods to push the boundaries of interdisciplinary imaging. -->

                    Prior to starting at Caltech, I was a postdoctoral fellow with the <a href="http://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon Telescope</a>, which published the first picture of a black hole in April of 2019. 
                    I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2017. 
                    <!-- , under the supervision of <a href="https://billf.mit.edu/">Bill Freeman</a>. -->
                    I previously received a B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI in 2011 and an S.M. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2013. </p>
