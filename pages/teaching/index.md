Quite a bit of my knowledge has come from informal education--mentors, friends, Google, and *lots* of trial and error. I care deeply about passing on what I've learned in order to help make CS and data science (and related endeavors) more approachable fields for both traditional computer scientists and "non"-computer scientists.


**Web Scraping**: [Caltech CS42: CS Education] [Summer 2020]. Wrote, got professor/peer feedback on, and revised tutorials as a part of CS Education course. [Part 1: Where is my data, and how can I access it?](https://github.com/james-bowden/teaching/blob/master/scraping_1.ipynb) covers the basics of scraping, web data (HTML), inspecting, and requests. [Part 2: But how do I extract the data I want?](https://github.com/james-bowden/teaching/blob/master/scraping_2.ipynb) covers string parsing, BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing), and wget (downloading data files from cmd line). **[Python] [Jupyter Notebook] [Bash]**

**Fundamentals of Investing**: [[Wave Learning Festival]](https://www.wavelf.org/) [Summer 2020]. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UZwIoobAfepDdWO-9U0Vv6EkG9O1V44pT2GLACMbgpU/edit?usp=sharing) available with notes covering the basics of investing, the stock market, indicators, and options. Taught 1100+ students (ranging from middle school to undergraduate) over the course of 4 waves (2-3 week long sessions) and received overwhelmingly positive feedback (4.5/5 overall rating).
