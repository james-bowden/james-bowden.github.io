Quite a bit of my knowledge has come from informal education--mentors, friends, Google, and ***lots*** of trial and error. I care deeply about passing on what I've learned in order to help make CS and data science (and related endeavors) more approachable fields for both traditional computer scientists and "non"-computer scientists.
