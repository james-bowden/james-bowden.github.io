Hi, I'm a rising sophomore at Caltech with machine learning and bioinformatics experience (and quite a bit of biomedical research background). Iâ€™m looking to develop impactful data processing/analysis techniques and related software. I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2021 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out! Check out my **[[resume]]({{site.github_url}}/assets/BowdenJames_Resume_08.20.pdf)**!

My current interests include: ML, adaptive experiment design, deep learning, data science, CV, NLP, bioinformatics, biological abstractions, cell-computer interfacing.
