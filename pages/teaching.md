Quite a bit of my knowledge has come from informal education--mentors, friends, Google, and *lots* of trial and error. I wish to pass on what I've learned to help
make CS and data science more approachable, easily understandable fields for both computer scientists and "non"-computer scientists.

**Web Scraping**. [Caltech CS42 (CS Education)] [Summer 2020] [Python] [Jupyter Notebook]. [Part 1: Where is my data, and how can I access it?](https://github.com/james-bowden/teaching/blob/master/scraping_1.ipynb) covers the basics of scraping, web data (HTML), inspecting, and requesting. [Part 2: But how do I extract the data I want?](https://github.com/james-bowden/teaching/blob/master/scraping_2.ipynb) covers string parsing, BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing), and wget (downloading data files from cmd line).

**Fundamentals of Investing**. [[Wave Learning Festival]](https://www.wavelf.org/) [Summer 2020]. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UZwIoobAfepDdWO-9U0Vv6EkG9O1V44pT2GLACMbgpU/edit?usp=sharing) available with notes.
