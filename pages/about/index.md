Hi, I'm a rising sophomore at Caltech with machine learning and bioinformatics experience (and quite a bit of biomedical research background). I’m looking to develop impactful data processing/analysis techniques and related software. My current interests include: ML, adaptive experiment design, deep learning, data science, CV, NLP, bioinformatics, biological abstractions, cell-computer interfacing. I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2021 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out! **[[Resume]]({{site.github_url}}/assets/BowdenJames_Resume_08.20.pdf)** **[[Email]](jbowden@caltech.edu)**

I play for Caltech's D3 [Water Polo Team](https://www.gocaltech.com/sports/mwaterpolo/index) and am a member of [Fleming House](http://www.fleming.caltech.edu/). As the Caltech Cannon Master, I fire and maintain Fleming's 1.3-ton, 130-year-old cannon throughout the year. I'm very passionate about teaching and mentoring; I've created tutorials and taught a virtual summer class and will be volunteering as a Frosh Camp Counselor this fall. I also invest in the stock market both personally and through [SIF](http://sif.caltech.edu/), for which I serve as Treasurer and Director of Research of a $1M portfolio. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends, reading (especially classics!), biking, and appreciating the outdoors. |
