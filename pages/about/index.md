  <b>Currently: Caltech '23. Studying CS, Data Science, Biology.**</b><br><br>

Hi, I'm a sophomore at Caltech with machine learning and bioinformatics experience (and quite a bit of biomedical research background). Iâ€™m looking to develop impactful data processing/analysis techniques and related software. My current interests include: ML, Bayesian inference, adaptive experiment design, deep learning, data science, CV, NLP, bioinformatics, biological abstractions, cell-computer interfacing. I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2021 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out! <a href="https://james-bowden.github.io/pages/resume/">Resume</a> <a href="jbowden@caltech.edu">Email</a><br><br>

I play for <a href="https://www.gocaltech.com/sports/mwaterpolo/index">Caltech's D3 Water Polo Team</a> and am a member of <a href="http://www.fleming.caltech.edu/">Fleming House</a>. As the Caltech Cannon Master, I fire and maintain Fleming's 1.3-ton, 130-year-old cannon throughout the year. I'm very passionate about teaching (more <a href="https://james-bowden.github.io/pages/teaching/">here</a>) and mentoring; I'm TAing Caltech's intro CS course this fall and am a paid Dean's tutor for several of Caltech's introductory math/science courses, I've created web scraping tutorials and taught an online summer class, and am volunteering as a Frosh Camp Counselor this fall. I serve on Caltech's Academics and Research Committee. I also invest in the stock market both personally and through <a href="http://sif.caltech.edu/">SIF</a>, for which I serve as Treasurer and Director of Research of a $1M portfolio. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends (via Zoom now...), reading (especially classics!; <a href="https://james-bowden.github.io/Book-List">book list</a>), biking, and getting outside. I'm also very happy to chat about any of the above if you're interested!
