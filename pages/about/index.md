**Currently: Caltech '23. Studying CS, Data Science, Biology.**

Hi, I'm a sophomore at Caltech with machine learning and bioinformatics experience (and quite a bit of biomedical research background). Iâ€™m looking to develop impactful data processing/analysis techniques and related software. My current interests include: ML, Bayesian inference, adaptive experiment design, deep learning, data science, CV, NLP, bioinformatics, biological abstractions, cell-computer interfacing. I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2021 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out! **[[Resume]](https://james-bowden.github.io/pages/resume/)** **[[Email]](jbowden@caltech.edu)**

I play for Caltech's D3 [Water Polo Team](https://www.gocaltech.com/sports/mwaterpolo/index) and am a member of [Fleming House](http://www.fleming.caltech.edu/). As the Caltech Cannon Master, I fire and maintain Fleming's 1.3-ton, 130-year-old cannon throughout the year. I'm very passionate about teaching (more [here](https://james-bowden.github.io/pages/teaching/)) and mentoring; I'm TAing Caltech's intro CS course this fall and am a paid Dean's tutor for several of Caltech's introductory math/science courses, I've created web scraping tutorials and taught an online summer class, and am volunteering as a Frosh Camp Counselor this fall. I serve on Caltech's Academics and Research Committee. I also invest in the stock market both personally and through [SIF](http://sif.caltech.edu/), for which I serve as Treasurer and Director of Research of a $1M portfolio. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with friends (via Zoom now...), reading (especially classics!; [book list](https://james-bowden.github.io/Book-List)), biking, and getting outside. I'm also very happy to chat about any of the above if you're interested!

As you can likely imagine, I did not get here alone and have been supported by **many** people along the way. Here's a list of just a few of these people, whose mentorship and guidance has made a huge difference and whom I am beyond thankful to have in my corner. This is most certainly **not** all-inclusive.
